3. My main goal - to do my best on this course,because I want to become a very good programmer. I'm honest, self-motivation and very very positive. I always sat "yes" when someone asks for help. To be honest, I'm a bit lazy in things I'm not interested, but it not about programming. Its so exciting to do something that never exist before. and when you learn something new every minute - its what I'm looking for.
4. HTML, CSS, JS basics. 
5. I have no experience on programming , self-educated.
6.  I was studying at the BSUIR and graduated in 2018.
7. A2.
